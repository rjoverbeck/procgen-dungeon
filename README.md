# Procgen Dungeon

## Description
A 2D top-down procedurally generated dungeon crawler.

## Background
This project was inspired by the following GDC talk [Tile-Based Map Generation using Wave Function Collapse in 'Caves of Qud'](https://youtu.be/AdCgi9E90jw?si=-05NpQSVso2rDXwl).

## Purpose
To explore the use of several algorithms (listed below) for procedurally generating dungeons.
- Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)
- Random Walk
- Wave Function Collapse (WFC)
