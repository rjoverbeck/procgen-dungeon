# Procgen Dungeon

## Description
The beginnings of a 2D top-down procedurally generated dungeon crawler. In its current state the player can move about a tilemap generated by one of three procedural generation algorithms.

## Background
This project was inspired by the following GDC talk [Tile-Based Map Generation using Wave Function Collapse in 'Caves of Qud'](https://youtu.be/AdCgi9E90jw?si=-05NpQSVso2rDXwl).

## Purpose
To explore the use of several algorithms (listed below) for procedurally generating dungeons.
- Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)
- Random Walk
- Wave Function Collapse (WFC)

## Instructions
This repository contains both a Unity (6000.0.29f1) project in the 'Procgen Dungeon' folder and a LaTeX paper in the 'Extras' folder. To open the project clone the repository then in Unity Hub go to Add > Add project from disk and navigate to the repo location.
